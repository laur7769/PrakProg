My index in the spreadsheet was 4, so I have done project 4, cholesky. 
The code in this project and the rest of the repository is tuned to run on MacOS.
In this exam project a routine for Choleksy decomposition has been implemented. 
The details of the specific algortihm used, as well as the methods for implementing the linear equation solver, matrix inverse method and detminant method is described in the Out.txt, where the results are also found. 
Throughout the project, it is assumed that the routine should work on real symmetric positive definite matrices, as also specified in the project decription.
I believe the exam project should be 10/10 points, as all routines mentioned in the project description have been implemented.
Furthermore, the time scaling of the impelemted decomposition routine has been investigated, and compared to the results from homework assignment 1, QR-decomposition.
