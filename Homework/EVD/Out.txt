B. Hydrogen Atom, s-wave radial Schrödinger equation on a grid

Firstly, to prove that f(r → 0) = r-r² → 0, the expression is rewritten.
r-r²=r*(1-r)
When r becomes smaller in the above expression, the whole expression goes towards r. As r → 0, r*(1-r) → 0.
The plots showing convergence with rmax and ∆r can be seen in dr.gnuplot.svg and rmax.gnuplot.svg.
Plot of ε[0] as a function of ∆r with rmax=10 can be seen in dr.gnuplot.svg 
From this plot ε[0] only comes close to converging at very low ∆r with rmax at this value. 
Plot of ε[0] as a function of r_max with ∆r=0.3 can be seen in rmax.gnuplot.svg
From this plot ε[0] seems to converge at rmax above 8, however it does not converge to the right ε[0], which should be -0.5 Hartree.
The lowest 4 eigenfunctions plotted against the analytical solutions can be seen in fr.gnuplot.svg
For calculations rmax was chosen to be 50, as some of the higher quantum number analytical functions only goes towards 0 at this rmax.
Furthermore, dr was chosen to be 0.3.

C. Scaling and optimization

Here the scaling of the diagonalization time with matrix size is investigated.
This is done by running diagonalization of various N size matrices in parallel.
The results can be seen in times.gnuplot.svg. By fitting both a*N^3 and b*N^2 to the data, it seems as the time scales with N^2.
