A. Jacobi diagonalization with cyclic sweeps

Check implementation:
V^TV=I? True
VV^T=I? True
VDV^T=A? True
V^TAV=D? True

B. Hydrogen Atom, s-wave radial Schrödinger equation on a grid

The plots showing convergence with rmax and ∆r can be seen in dr.gnuplot.svg and rmax.gnuplot.svg.
The the lowest eigen functions plotted against the analytical solutions can be seen in fr.gnuplot.svg

C. Scaling and optimization

Here the scaling of the diagonalization time with matrix size is investigated.
This is done by rinning diagonalization ov various N size matrices in parallel.
The results can be seen in times.gnuplot.svg. By fitting both a*N^3 and b*N^2 to the data, it seems as the time scales with N^2.
Plot of ε[0] as a function of ∆r with rmax=10 can be seen in dr.gnuplot.svg 
Plot with the computed first 4 eigenfunctions and analytical results can be seen in fr.gnuplot.svg
For the eigenfunctions r_max=10 and ∆r=0.025. This was determined based on the plots in dr.gnuplot.svg and rmax.gnuplot.svg
Plot of ε[0] as a function of r_max with ∆r=0.3 can be seen in rmax.gnuplot.svg
