Plot of ε[0] as a function of ∆r with rmax=10 can be seen in dr.gnuplot.svg 
Plot of ε[0] as a function of r_max with ∆r=0.3 can be seen in rmax.gnuplot.svg 
Plot with the computed first 4 eigenfunctions and analytical results can be seen in fr.gnuplot.svg
For the eigenfunctions r_max=10 and ∆r=0.025. This was determined based on the plots in dr.gnuplot.svg and rmax.gnuplot.svg
