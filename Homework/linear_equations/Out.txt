A. Solving linear equations using QR-decomposition by modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization

Check decomp method using matric.approx method with default accuracy:
Is R upper triangular? True
Is Q^TQ=I? True
Is QR=A? True
Check solve method using vector.approx method with default accuracy:
Is Ax=b?: True
The decomp and solve methods work as inteded.

B. Matrix inverse by Gram-Schmidt QR factorization

Check inverse method using matrix.approx method with default accuracy:
Is AB=I? True
The inverse method works as inteded.

C. Operations count for QR-decomposition
The measured time of a QR-decomposition as a function of matrix size N can be seen plotted in times.gnuplot.svg.
The measurements are plotted against a fitted a*N^3 function. The plot clearly shows a N^3 increase in time.
