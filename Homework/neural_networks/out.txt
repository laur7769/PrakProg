The response of the trained neural network with n=12 and trained on 400 data points can be seen plotted against g(x) in A.gnuplot.svg.

B.  
The neural network with activation function f=x*exp(-x^2) has been modified to include methods giving the first and second derivative as well as the anti-derivative.
The first and scond derivative as well as the anti-derivative for a neural network trained on g(x) can be seen plotteed against the analytical functions in B.gnuplot.svg.
