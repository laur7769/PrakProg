A. Plain Monte Carlo integration
     - Test implemented plain MC on ∫_0^1∫_0^1 exp(-(x^2+y^2)) dx dy=0.557746. The estimated and actual error as a funciton of N is plotted in MCA.gnuplot.svg
     - As can be seen in the plot, the estimated error follows the actual error pretty well. As the estimated error as calculated from a*1/√N, with a being a constant, it is confirmed that the actual error scales with 1/√N
    -Is the computed value the same as the table value for ∫0^π  dx/π ∫0^π  dy/π ∫0^π  dz/π [1-cos(x)cos(y)cos(z)]^-1?
       Computed value with N=500000: 1.38865484806683
        Table value = 1.3932039296856768591842462603255 

B. Quasi-random sequences
 - Test implemented Halton MC on ∫_0^1∫_0^1 exp(-(x^2+y^2)) dx dy=0.557746.
     - The estimated and actual error as a funciton of N is plotted in MCB.gnuplot.svg 
     - As can be seen, the estimated error varies to a higher degree compared to the actual error.
     - The estimated error of plain MC is also plotted agagin in MCB.gnuplot.svg, and is comapred to the actual and estimated error of the halton MC
     - As mentioned earlier, the estimated error of the plain MC scales with 1/√N and accurately describes the scaling of the actual plain MC error.
     - When comparing this the the actual error of Halton MC, it is seen how the actual Halton MC error decreases faster than the 1/√N plain MC error
     - The Halton MC therefor improves the scaling with N compared to the plain MC.

C. Stratified sampling
     - The implemented stratified sampling routine is tested on ∫_0^1∫_0^1 exp(-(x^2+y^2)) dx dy=0.557746 
     - Computed value with N=5000: 0.557130982158872
     - Computed estimated error: 0.000728402094611806
     - Actual error 0.00061501784112783
     - The actual and estimated error of the stratified sampling is plotted as a function of N in MCC.gnuplot.svg
     - When compared to the estimated error for the plain MC, the error scaling with N is significantly improved with the stratified sampling.
     - Its also improved with respect to ther Halton MC
